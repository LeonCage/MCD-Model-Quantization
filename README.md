# MCD Model Analysis

## Description
This repository contains code and scripts for evaluating and comparing pruned, quantized, and fine-tuned MCD models. It includes model size comparison, sensitivity analysis, and visualization of results.

## Project Structure
- `bash/` : Bash scripts (to be added)
- `reader.py` : Main Python script (to be added)
- `README.md` : This file

<<<<<<< HEAD
- `src/` - Source code files including training, evaluation, pruning, quantization, and sensitivity analysis scripts.
- `models/` - Saved model checkpoints before and after pruning/quantization.
- `plots/` - Generated plots such as confusion matrices and sensitivity bar charts.
- `data/` - Dataset folder (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies required for the project.

## Features

- Evaluate model performance using loss, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Prune and quantize the MCD model to reduce size and increase efficiency.
- Conduct layer-wise sensitivity analysis to understand parameter importance.
- Visualize results using matplotlib.
